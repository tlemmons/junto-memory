    Connection diagnostic — confirm the server is reachable and healthy.

    This tool does NOT require a session. Use it before memory_start_session
    to verify connectivity, or after a transport error to distinguish
    "server down" from "session expired" from "client misconfigured."

    Use this as your heartbeat target. A client wrapper can poll it on a
    regular interval (10-60s); any error or timeout means the MCP transport
    may be silently broken — warn the operator loudly rather than swallow it.

    Returns JSON with:
    - status: "ok" | "degraded" | "error"
    - server_version: current junto-memory version string
    - server_time: current UTC timestamp (useful for clock-skew detection)
    - uptime_seconds: seconds since server process started
    - storage: when include_storage=True, mongo ping result

    Args:
        include_storage: When True (default), pings Mongo for storage
            confirmation. Set False for the very lightest possible health
            check (responds quickly but doesn't verify backend storage).
