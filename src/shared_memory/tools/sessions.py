# Curated "use-when" hints for tools agents commonly miss in deferred-tool-load
# harnesses (Claude Code et al.), where only tool *names* appear until a
# ToolSearch. Surfaced in every memory_start_session response so the discovery
# work doesn't depend on name-scanning alone.
#
# Design constraints (see backlog notable_tools follow-up):
#  - Capped at 5 entries. Bounds the token cost of every session start.
#  - NO rotation. This block is byte-stable across calls on purpose — the
#    response is assembled stable→dynamic for Anthropic prefix-cache hits
#    (see the field-order note below). Rotating would change the prefix every
#    call and forfeit that. If the list outgrows 5, prune — don't rotate.
#  - Edit this constant when the tool surface changes; keep the most
#    impactful/recently-added tools at the top.

    START HERE - Call this first before any other memory tools.

    Registers your session and returns:
    - Your session ID (required for all other calls)
    - Recent relevant learnings for your project
    - Active work by other Claudes (avoid conflicts)
    - Handoff notes from previous sessions
    - Active file locks in your working area
    - Signals from other agents (completion notifications)
    - Who you might be blocking
    - Interface updates since your last session

    You MUST call this at the start of your work.

    Args:
        project: Project you're working on (e.g., 'emailtriage', 'nimbus')
        claude_instance: Identifier for this agent (e.g., 'main', 'agent-1')
        task_description: Brief description of what you're about to work on
        tmux_target: Optional delivery target routing string (opaque, used by
            external dispatcher; leave blank unless your setup uses one)
        role_description: What this agent does (e.g., 'Core triage/classification engine').
            Set once - persists across sessions. Other agents can discover you via memory_list_agents.
        working_directory: Your working directory path. Used to auto-identify your agent name
            if path patterns are registered for this project.
        spawned_by: Parent agent that spawned this worker (for worker tier agents).
        api_key: API key for authentication (required when MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true).
        subscribed_components: Optional list of component names (sub-groups under
            this project) this agent is working in (design:unified-messaging-v0
            Stage 1 — ADDRESSING). Persisted on the agent_directory record;
            session start surfaces a `component_peers` list of OTHER agents
            recently active in any of these components. Stage 1 is discovery
            only — component-addressed pub/sub delivery + claiming arrive in
            Stages 2-3. Omit (default) for nimbus's direct-send world.
        aliases: Optional alternate names this agent should also receive
            messages under (e.g. a lead agent claiming "coordinator"). Senders
            addressing any alias are redirected to this agent. Enforced unique
            per project — an alias that collides with a live agent name or
            another agent's alias is rejected (surfaced in `registry_warning`).
            None = leave existing aliases untouched; [] = clear them.
        principal: Service-principal session mode (design:identity-lifecycle-v0
            Mechanism A; first consumer: subConscience runtime subs). Requires a
            VALIDATED api key (arg or Bearer header) — keyless/soft-auth
            sessions are rejected as principals. The session authenticates and
            scopes like any other, but is INVISIBLE BY CONSTRUCTION: no
            registered_agents row, no agent_directory row, and it is filtered
            from active-work / other-claudes enumeration. A principal can never
            be a message RECIPIENT (send-validation is roster-based, and there
            is no roster row). Lifecycle = key lifecycle (revoke to kill).
